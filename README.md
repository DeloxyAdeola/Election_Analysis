ELECTION - AUDIT SUMMARY

This script used for the election audit sumarry was a useful, precise and efficient method in determining the number of counts per candidate and county, percentage of  votes for each county and candidate based on the total votes. with some refactoring on this code, it  could be used during regional, state and country election. it can also be used for county votes. if dataset is being provided to give a break down of votes, this script will be efficient enough to carry out a precise outcome of any county vote. When refactored it can be used nationally.
